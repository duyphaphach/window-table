# Adding Event Listeners

In this guide, we will explore how we can leverage the
customizability of this library to add a table row **event listener**
in a matter of few lines of code.

To explain this concept, we will add a click listener to the
rows of the table. let's have a
sneak peak at what we are going to achieve.
Go ahead and click on a row.

<RowEventListener />

For the purpose of styling, we will use a bootstrap based
library called `stylestrap`, but pretty much any library
out there can be used for that.

First let's see what the final implementation looks like.

```jsx harmony
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Html5Table } from 'window-table';

// Components like `Card`, `CardHeader`... come from the stylestrap library

// We store the state handler outside the component
// This is done only as a performance optimization
const handlers = {
  setState: null
};

// Here we define our custom Row component
// along with our intended click event listener
// index: The index of each row being rendered
const CustomRow = ({ index, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <tr
      // Here we call the stored state handler
      onClick={() => handlers.setState(index)}

      // It's important that we pass all the remaining props here
      {...rest}
    />
  );
};

export default function ShinobiTable(props) {
  const [state, setState] = useState({});

  // Store the setState handler in an object outside the parent component
  // This is done, only as a performance optimization
  handlers.setState = rowIndex => {
    // Given the rowIndex of the clicked row, we store the corresponding data in the state
    // rowIndex is passed from the CustomRow onClick handler
    setState(data[rowIndex]);
  };

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardBody>
        <Html5Table
          // Here we pass our customized Row component
          Row={CustomRow}
          // data and columns come from an internal helper
          // More props can be passed for styling and customizing
          data={data}
          columns={columns}
        />
      </CardBody>
      <CardFooter>
        {/*Code for showing the selection goes here. For now, just show the stringified data*/}
        {JSON.stringify(state)}
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

As you can see, all of the techniques used here are plain
React patterns. We are not introducing any black magic, and instead
we leverage the known React patterns.

**Let's go through the important pieces of code which ensures
both flexibility and performance.**

## Custom Components
In this guide, we created our own custom Row component. This allows
us to customize pretty much anything in addition to the event
listener we added. For example, you can add classNames, inline-styles,
use a component from a 3rd party components library and what not.

```jsx harmony
const CustomRow = props => {
  // Here we are using the `Tr` component from stylestrap
  // ...which allows us to pass in a css attribute
  return (
    <Tr
      {...props} // It is important that we forward the original props
      styles={{
        // It is important that we merge the original styles
        // See the components API for more details
        ...props.styles,
        cursor: 'pointer'
      }}
      css={{ background: '#EEE'}}
      onMouseDown={e => { /* Do something on Mouse Move*/ }}
    />
  );
}
```
As commented on the code snippet above, it is important that
we forward the original props. This is because, WindowTable internally
passes such attributes which are crucial for the rows to
get windowed as expected. If you are using the style attribute,
you should merge it with the original styles as above.
Yet, you would normally avoid using inline styles anyway.

If you head on to the Components API, you will see that all
other Table elements like, `Table`, `Body`, `Cell`, etc can be
fully customized in the same way as above.

## External Event handlers
I bet the first thing you noticed about this example is that
we store the `setState` function outside the `ShinobiTable`
component. This has nothing to do with `window-table` itself.
This is a powerful technique to prevent unnecessary re-renders in React.

We want to access `setState` from the `onClick` listener
of `CustomRow`. The most intuitive way of doing that is to
define the component inside the ShinobiTable.

```jsx harmony
export default function ShinobiTable(props) {
  const [rowIndex, setRowIndex] = useState({});
  const CustomRow = ({index, ...props}) => {
    return <tr onClick={() => setRowIndex(index)} {...props} />
  };

  return <WindowTable {/*props*/} />
}
```

However, if we do that, the `CustomRow` will be declared
on each row click. This is because, the component internal
state is changed every time we call `setRowIndex`, making
React trigger another render.

The performance impact explained here may not be
visible to the eye at first, but will start to appear as the
application grows.

One way of working around this issue is by using the `React.useMemo`
hook. We can wrap the CustomRow in a useMemo call as follows.
Then, `CustomRow` will not be updated every time `rowIndex` changes.

```jsx harmony
const CustomRow = useMemo(
  () => ({index, props}) => {
    return <tr onClick={() => setRowIndex(index)} {...props} />
  },
  [setRowIndex]
)
```

You can use this technique if you prefer that, or else,
we can avoid the issue in the first place, by defining the
`CustomRow` component outside of the `ShinobiTable`.
However, this takes the access to the `setRowIndex` function
away from the `CustomRow`. This can be solved by attaching the
function to a regular JS object defined outside of both the
components, as shown in the first example.

This may first seem like React's context, except, changes to
this plain JS object does not trigger any re-renders.

## Using row instead of row Index
In the above example, we used the `index` prop to find the row index
and then used it to find the row data from `data`. A shorter way to
access the row data is to use the `row` prop directly.

```jsx harmony
const CustomRow = ({index, row, ...props}) => {
  console.log(data[index]); // {id: 2, name: 'Naruto', ...}
  console.log(row); // {id: 2, name: 'Naruto', ...}

  // render TableRow.
}
```

# Striped Table
The most common way of adding strips to a table is using CSS.
You would simply define a CSS rule as follows, or may even
just add the `table-striped` class name with Bootstrap.

```css
tr:nth-of-type(odd) {
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);
}
```

**Unfortunately though, this strategy cannot be used with a
windowed table**. Table rows are created and destroyed as you scroll,
changing the odd-even nature of the rows. This would cause the
table strips to flip as you scroll, causing a janky behaviour.

<ShinobiTable
  className="table-sm table-striped"
/>

So we will introduce two escape hatches which will allow you
to do striped tabled with a minimal effort.

## Using the `rowClassName` prop
The rowClassName prop can accept either a string or a function.

When a function is provided, it will be passed the index of the
row that is being rendered. Thus we can check the odd-even nature
of the index and apply a className to change the background color.

```jsx harmony
<Table
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  rowClassName={index => (index % 2 === 0 ? 'even-row' : 'odd-row')}
/>
```

And then apply a CSS rule for the className as follows,

```css
.odd-row {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}
```

## Using the `Row` prop
You've seen that the WindowTable components allow you to
pass custom components for the different "parts" of the
table. Thus you can pass a custom Row component to get strips.

```jsx harmony
const StripedRow = props => {
 return (
   <tr {...props} style={{
     ...props.style,
     background: props.index % 2 === 0 ? 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)' : '#FFF'
   }}/>
 );
};

<Table
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  Row={StripedRow}
/>
```

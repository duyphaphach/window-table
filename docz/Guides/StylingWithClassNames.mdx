# Styling With ClassNames

One of the most common ways of styling Window-Tables is by using CSS class names.

The following table shows the list of components in a typical window-table,
and their corresponding default class names and tag name in HTML5Table

Component | Default className | Tag Name in HTML5Table
:--- | :--- | :---
Table | `table` | `table`
Table Heading | `table-header` | `thead`
Table Heading Row(s) | `table-header-row` | `tr`
Table Heading Cell(s) | `table-header-cell` | `th`
Table Body | `table-body` | `tbody`
Table Body Row(s) | `table-row` | `tr`
Table Body Cell(s) | `table-cell` | `td`

These class names can be used to style the table as follows:

```css
.table {
  width: 80%
}

.table-cell {
  color: red
}
```

## Class Name Conflicts
This works great so far. However, there can be scenarios where the simple class names conflict with the
styles from another framework, library or even app specific css.

This problem can be easily avoided by providing a className prefix to the table.

```jsx
<WindowTable
 data={data}
 columns={columns}
 classNamePrefix="awesome_window_"
/>
```

Now, all the simple class names above will be prefixed by `awesome_window_`.
So the above CSS can now be written as:

```css
.awesome_window_table {
  width: 80%
}

.awesome_window_table-cell {
  color: red
}
```

You can also provide a root class name to the window table, and write your css based on that.
This prevents WindowTable related styles polluting other parts of your application, **but not the
other way around.**

```jsx
<WindowTable
 data={data}
 columns={columns}
 className="awesome_window_table"
/>
```
```css
.awesome_window_table .table {
  width: 80%
}

.awesome_window_table .table-cell {
  color: red
}
```

## Row Class Names
Table Rows in the table are special in the context of WindowTable, the reason being, well, windowing.

Therefore, we provide a way to pass in a function to derive class names for rows, in addition to the
static class names as above. The function will be called with the index of the row that is being
rendered.

```jsx
<WindowTable
 data={data}
 columns={columns}
 rowClassName={index => (index % 2 === 0 ? 'even-row' : 'odd-row')}
/>
```

With the above implementation, all the even rows in the table will have the `even-row` class name,
and all the rest of the rows will have the `odd-row` class name.

This concept is also demonstrated in the "StripedTable" section in the guides.

# Filtering

As of today, window-table does not expose a built in filter input.
Instead, it exports utilities to make your own filter easily,
in a matter of few lines of code.

Let's have a sneak peak at what
we are going to build, and the code(excluding styles) for that.

<BasicFilterTable />

```jsx harmony
import { Html5Table as Table, useDebouncedState, createFilter, useFilter } from 'window-table';
const filterFn = createFilter(['name', 'clan']); // Enable search by name and search by clan

function ShinobiTable(props) {
  // An alternative for `useState` for a better user experience
  // `text` as input value and `debouncedText` for filtering
  const [text, debouncedText, setText] = useDebouncedState('');

  // Rather than calling `filterFn` directly, we call it indirectly using the useFilter hook
  // Same as `filterFn(data, debouncedText)`, but faster
  const filteredData = useFilter(filterFn, data, debouncedText);

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} value={text} />
      <Table data={filteredData} columns={columns} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Simple enough right?
Now let's have a look at what each of the code chunks mean.

## The filter function
In the above example, we used the `createFilter` utility
to create a filter function. Basically, you tell it by which
field(s) you want to filter the data on.

Instead, let's create our own filter function to see how that
works internally.

Given a `data` array and a `filterText` string, the
function should return the filtered data. Let's use the
`array.filter` and `array.includes` native functions to
do the filtering. For now, let's do filtering based on the
`name` attribute only:

```jsx harmony
function filterData(data, filterText) {
  return data.filter(datum => datum.name.includes(filterText));
}
```

The `createFilter` utility we used in the above example is not
much different from that. The two main differences are:

* Instead of using just one field name,
it allows us to base filtering on multiple attributes.
* Makes the filtering **case insensitive**
(by using `toLowercase` at filter time)

The built-in `createFilter` method covers most trivial cases.
If you want to do some advanced filter magic,
ee the [FuzzySearch](#fuzzy-search) section to learn how we
can use a 3rd party library for the filter function.

## The `UseDebouncedState` hook
Remember that our table has thousands of rows, making
performance a critical factor.

If we use a regular `useState`
hook to store the filter text, it will cause the search input to
freeze while the data is being filtered.
Thus instead, we use a debounced version of `useState`.

`const [state, debouncedState, setState] = useDebouncedState('', 50);`

`state` and `setState` are exactly the same as that from
`useState`. The `debouncedState` is a slight variation of state
which gets updated at most once per every `50`(default) milliseconds.

Anything more will be chunked together to avoid too many
calls to our filter function.

We can pass the `state` as the value for the `input` element since
we want the updates to show immediately on self. And we can
pass the `debouncedState` to the filter function.

## The `useFilter` hook
In the example above, instead of calling the filter function
directly, we used a hook to call it for us.

```jsx harmony
const filteredList1 = useFilter(filterFn, data, filterText);
const filteredList2 = filterFn(data, filterText);
```
Both `filteredList1` and `filteredList2` will have the same
filtered data. However, the one with the `useFilter` hook
returns the result much faster than the direct call.

To learn more and for the full API, there's a dedicated
API documentation section for these hooks.

## Fuzzy Search

In the example above, we used our own hand written filter function.
Now let's see how we can use a 3rd party library to do fuzzy
filtering for us.

In the following example, you will see that the filter
yields results even when there are small typos. Go ahead and
type something like  "Norto" or "Niruso" instead of "Naruto"
to see what that means.

<FuzzyFilterTable />

Now let's see how we can change our code to support that.

We'll use the `fuse.js` library here, but the idea is you can use
pretty much any library out there.

All we got to do is, change the filterFn from above.

```jsx harmony
import Fuse from 'fuse.js';

// Comment out the original filterFn
// const filterFn = createFilter(['name', 'clan']); // Enable search by name and search by clan

// Write the new fuzzy search function
const filterFn = (dataList, filterText) => {
  const fuse = new Fuse(dataList, {
    threshold: 0.5,
    keys: ['name', 'clan']
  });
  return fuse.search(filterText);
}

```

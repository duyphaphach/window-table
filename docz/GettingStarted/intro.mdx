# Window-Table
Window Table is a fixed data table for React, which is capable of rendering thousands of rows of data
without compromising performance. The following table renders **100,000** rows of data.

<ShinobiTable rowClassName={index => (index % 2 === 0 ? 'even-row' : 'odd-row')} />

<GhStars />

Now Let's have a quick look at the minimal code we needed to get started.
Note that we are using [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/) table classes for styling.
```jsx harmony
<Html5Table
    data={data}
    columns={columns}
    className="table-sm"
    headerClassName="thead-dark"
/>
```

## HTML5 tags ðŸ’…
One of the biggest pain points in using a fixed data table is styling. In contrast, basic HTML5 tags based tables
can be easily styled using an off the shelf style system like bootstrap.

Thus, you can optionally use default HTML 5 tags like `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `td` and `th` for the table
nodes by importing the `HTML5Table` component from this library.

```jsx harmony
import { Html5Table } from 'window-table';
```

## Tiny Footprint ðŸ‘¶
The code for this library is written in a way which minimizes the lines of code
while still allowing the users to customize and extend it however they want.

## Alternatives
* [React Fluid Table](https://mckervinc.github.io/react-fluid-table/#/),
a drop in replacement for window-table with a ton of more features.
* [React Base Table](https://autodesk.github.io/react-base-table),
a library which also offers a ton more features, with a slightly different API.

## Contributions welcome
I, the author of this library has been unable to provide support for the issues opened in the library
in the past few months. Contributions highly appreciated.
